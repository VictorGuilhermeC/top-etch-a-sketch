# Etch a Sketch - The Odin Project

A virtual Etch a Sketch built with HTML, CSS and Javascript, as part of the Odin Project's [Foundations Course](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-etch-a-sketch).

## Features

- Button with adjustable grid size (from 1x1 up to 100x100).

- Two drawing modes:

  - "Normal mode" → draws in black.
  - "Rainbow mode" → assigns a random color to each square.

- Progressive shading effect (squares darken as you hover multiple times).

- Reset button to clear the sketch and start fresh.

- Design inspired by the classic Etch-a-Sketch toy.

## Lessons learned

- Better use of Flexbox for design purposes

- Handling user input through prompts

- Working with event handlers and user interactions

- Dynamic creation and setting CSS property values

## Future improvements

As I progress on the Foundations Course, this project may include new features.
